# Fintek.co.il job interview


## Overview

To complete this test, you will need to write a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based web app, and provide us the source files to be built.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your **skills and approach to composing a simple web app** given a screem and a json feed. We will also assess the **generated HTML, CSS, and JS** output.


## The Challenge

It's pretty simple. Using the provided screen as a reference, you'll need to build a set of React components to render the app. You'll also need to request a JSON feed and display a few results.

If needed, please include a `README` with setup instructions.

## Details

Refer to the [screens/home.jpg](./screens/home.jpg) screen.

You will need to build one page site that display staff information to the client.

the staff json contain 100 rows but you need to display only 6 random rows,
exactly as the screen shows.

The page should also be usable on mobile and tablet devices.

You can assume that you do not have to support legacy browsers without features such `flexbox`,
for example.


## FAQ

### What language, framework, build tool... should I use?

You may use whatever you like as long as the solution is built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

We prefer it if you did not use any third party CSS frameworks.
